# Adapter Pattern

## What is the adapter pattern?

In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as **wrapper**, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

## IRL example:

Let's say you're from America and you decide to go on a vacation trip to Europe. You take your flight and land safely in Spain(or wherever). You get to your hotel room and notice your phone's battery is plenty dead from navigating to get you there. You decide to charge it before leaving to party and you notice the socket in your hotel room does not couple with the pins of your charger([PANIK](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/panik-kalm)). Of course you could easily charge your phone through USB connection but... bear with me... For convenience sake, you call the hotel managment and request a pin **adapter** for your charger to connect to the wall socket. Management comes up your room, gives you your new([KALM](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/panik-kalm)) **adapter** and charges you an inordinate amount of money([{{PANIK}}](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/panik-kalm)) for it upon checkout. You plug the charger into the **adapter** and the **adapter** into the wall socket ET VOILA, you have officially used an **adapter** IRL.

## When to use?

- There is a class whose interfaces do not match the one you need.

- There are several subclasses but itâ€™s impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one.

## Types of Adapter Implementations

There are two implementations of this pattern:

- The object adapter implements the target interface by delegating to an adaptee object at run-time.

- The class adapter implements the target interface by inheriting from an adaptee class at compiler-time.

## Examples

Within the `/src` dir you will find an examples of the adapter pattern.

## To run the tests

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run test`

These tests were created to verify instantiability of all classes and the adapater implementation for the android class into the warrior class.
